🚀 SECTION 10 AND 11: NAVIGATING JUPYTER

I already am familiar with jupyter so only noting down any new things and some shortcuts here:
  🧠 Shift + Enter = create a new coding cell in jupyter instead of manually adding in using the plus button below an existing cell.
  🧠 Ctrl + Shift + Enter = gives u a list of all keyboard shortcuts you can use in the jupyterlab.
  🧠 Restarting a kernel = helps clear outputs of all cells and lets u start fresh.
      Alternatively, u can do restart kernel and run all cells to execute the whole file fresh from scratch.

🚀 SECTION 12: PYTHON VARS AND DATA TYPES

- made a small blunder with using the printf statement so adding it here:
m = 100
print(f"{m} days")

- use anaconda assistant (its like an inbuilt AI assistant) if u get stuck w sm related to the IDE or ur code.

🚀 SECTION 13 to 19: all coding exercises and a roleplay to help brush up on python basics and some more complicated stuff like list comprehensions and lambda functions etc.
