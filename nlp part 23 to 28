🚀 SECTION 23: SENTIMENT ANALYSIS

1. Lexicon / Rule - based analysis:
    - a lexicon is basically a collection of words paired with their predefined sentient scores.
    - uses a set of predefined rules that connect words to emotions / attitudes.
    - each word is assigned a polarity score (a number which indicates if the word is positive, negative or neutral)
    - score usually ranges from -1 to 1.
    
Two popular python packages that follow lexicon method:
  📌 TextBlob:
    - gives one single score to each sentence that you input
    - like only assigns 0.2 to a certain sentence
  📌 VADER:
    - gives a score in each category for a sentence
    - gives 0.8 positive -0.9 negative and 0.2 neutral to a certain sentence.

2. Pre - trained Transformers
    - captures how words influence and relate to each other even if they appear far apart in a sentence.
    - basically they understand context.

🚀 SECTION 24: TEXT VECTORIZATION

(basically converting text data into numerical vectors that a machine can understand and learn through)

1. Bag of Words model:
    - just counts which words appear in which documents.
    - common libraries are scikit-learn(count vectorizer)

2. Term Frequency Inverse Document Frequency (TF - IDF):
    - calculates relative frequency of words within a document
    - basically tells us how important that word is
    - more common a word, lower the score
    - less common a word, higher the score.

🚀 SECTION 25: TOPIC MODELLING

(basically identifying patterns in large datasets)
there are two algorithms:

1. LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation)
    - Uses probability and Bayesian inference to discover latent topics. It is a generative probabilistic model.
    - More interpretable. Outputs explicit, meaningful topics as lists of words with probabilities (e.g., "gene, dna, cell").
    - Handles polysemy better. A word like "bank" can appear in multiple topics (e.g., a "finance" topic and a "river" topic) with different probabilities.

2. LSA (Latent Semantic Analysis)
    - Uses linear algebra (Singular Value Decomposition) to find hidden semantic spaces. It is a bag-of-words model.
    - Less interpretable. The "concepts" it finds are mathematical constructs (eigenvectors) that are hard to label as coherent topics.
    - Struggles with polysemy (words with multiple meanings). It places a word in a single, broad conceptual vector.


🚀 SECTION 26: BUILDING YOUR OWN TEXT CLASSIFIER

📌 Logistic Regression:
    - It is different from linear regression whose task i sto predict a certain continuous number value.
    - logistic one is used to predict classes, example: will this student pass or fail?

📌 Naive Bayes:
    - a simple classificaiton algorithm that works using probabilities. 
    - basically it'll tell us what the probability of student failing and that of passing is.

📌 Linear SVM (support vector machine)
    - finds the best possible boundary that separates different categories.
