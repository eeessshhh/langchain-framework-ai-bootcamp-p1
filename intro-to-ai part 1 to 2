🚀 Section 1: Getting started!

DEFINITIONS:
🟢 Data Science: Umbrella term for a field that includes extracting insights from data and using it for a certain motive.
🟢 AI: Creating algorithms / machines that can perform human tasks.
🟢 ML: The ability of a system to learn on its own and improve based on training given to it.
🟢 Deep Learning: A subset of ML that uses Artificial Neural Networks with multiple layers to learn from data.

WEAK AI v/s STRONG AI:
- weak AI (eg: chatgpt) needs a user to input stuff and ask it to perform tasks.
- strong AI (AGI or Artificial General Intelligence) is yet to be pursued and will be able to create and discover stuff on its own.

🚀 Section 2: Data talk.

🎯 Structured and unstructured data:

Structured and unstructured data are two main types of data. In real life we are most commonly faced with unstructured data. 
For example: MNIST dataset: thousands of graphic images of handwritten numbers. 
For another example: Videos and images are nothing but pixel value ranges noted in binary or other counting methods and get transcribed accordingly into a computer.
The goal is to find a way to convert unstructured data into structured, so that machines can understand and learn from it.

🎯 Labelled and unlabelled data:

These are the two primary methods of collecting and preparing data for AI modelling.
Labelled data is where categories in data are defined. Is this a picture of a dog or not? Is this review positive or negative or neutral?
Unlabelled data does not have defined categories when giving it to the model to train on.

🎯 Metadata:

It is basically the data that describes our dataset.
